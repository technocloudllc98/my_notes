CREATE LOCAL REPO
-------------------------------
* We need a file "repodata" only createrepo command can create this file, you already have this file in dvd, so copy the whole dvd
* If you dont have whole dvd avalilable, use command createrepo /copied_folder, after copying the packages.
* gpgcheck should be 0 
* cleanall > update > repolist
* if you are copying whole folder then don't forget to use -r (recursively)
	# cp -rv * /destinstion
* cd - : take you to your last working directory
* sudo !! : run the previous command with sudo pri


DISK PARTITIONING
------------------------------
* in LVM & LUKS disks don't create filesystem after creation of standard disks, first follow all the procedures on disk
& then create the filesystem and mount that device in the last.
* always use /dev/.....


FILE PERMISSION
--------------------------
* in file/directory permission ques, always start with "ls -l /directory or file_name" to get an overview of what is available
  and what you need to configure on that file or directory.
* First configure file/directory ownership <  file/directory permission <Special permission (GID) & Sticky bit <  ACL.
* linux doesn't define owner of a group, you can only set user owner and group owner of a file/directory.
** Always use Special Permission in a shared permission environment.

Ownership : # chown -R bob:account account/        (bob is the owner of acc group as well as acc/, remove bob if group owner is not specified)
permission : # chmod 770 account/
Spe. Perm. : # chmod g+s account/	(set gid - all user of group will get write permission, it will also inherit the permission to newly created files)
		  : # chmod +t *         		(in data/, sticky bits on all files =delete files only if u r the owner of group/file or root)
ACL		  : # setfacl -R -m g:............ 	(current ACL)
		  : # setfacl -m d:g:.............	(default ACL)
